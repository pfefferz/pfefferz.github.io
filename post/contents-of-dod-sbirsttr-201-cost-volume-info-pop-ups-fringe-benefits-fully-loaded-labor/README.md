# Contents of DoD SBIR/STTR 20.1 Cost Volume Info Pop-Ups: Fringe Benefits, Fully Loaded Labor Rate, e

![small_buisness_administration_logo_1](small_buisness_administration_logo_1.png)

This post presents the contents of the "info pop-ups" on each page of the DoD SBIR/STTR 20.1 Vol III Cost Volume online form and the Labor Category Options available. I'm listing it because I could not find these without first getting into the form and I thought that other SBIR/STTR applicants that are putting their Cost Volumes together may like to see the "info pop-ups" and Labor Category Options outside the online form so that they can start their Cost Volumes outside their tool.

**Labor Categories**

"Labor Categories facilitate classification of the work/labor to be performed. The labor category chosen should be in alignment with the role. You must choose from the predefined list of labor categories, with the option to select "Not Specified" if there is no appropriate match."

**Fringe Benefits**

"Fringe benefits are employee associated costs such as health plan expenses, pension plan expenses and workman's compensation expenses, among others. These costs are expressed as a rate by employee class. The rate is the pooled costs of these benefits divided by the total salaries in each employee class."
