**Identification and Significance of the Innovation** help text:

To best assist decision makers in understanding the merit of your proposed technology solution, the following are key points to include: 

• Clear statement of "why" the idea is important - address the outstanding performance being promised and the degree to which the concept is new and different. 

• Honest assessment of the state-of-the-art (SOA) with the key performance parameters (KPP). 

• Quantitative assertions (e.g., x% improvement of y, x kg of mass saving, x meters of accuracy, code is x faster or z more accurate, etc.). 

• Expression of the problem/need in terms common to the decision maker and to a wider audience who may not all be experts in your field.
