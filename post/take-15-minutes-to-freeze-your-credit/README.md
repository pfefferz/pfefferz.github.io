# Take 15 Minutes to Freeze Your Credit

![credit_company_logos](credit_company_logos.png)

This page lists the direct links to freeze your credit at Equifax, Experian and TransUnion and reviews setting up a freeze at each: Equifax and Experian are easy, TransUnion is harder.  It took me 15 minutes to freeze my credit, 7 of which were finding the links. I was able to freeze my credit for free at each firm.

### Review

Equifax was the easiest.

I was able to find the link to freeze easily. At the the link I filled out a quick form online and got my pin.

Experian was second easiest.

I was able to find the link to freeze easily. At the link I filled out a quick form online. I was aksed to answer some questions to verify I was who I was. Then I got my pin.

TransUnion was the hardest.

I had to click through the "lock" they wanted to sell me before finding the freeze option. After finding it I had to create an account. After creating an account I needed to answer questions. One question was not relevant. TransUnion then asked me to call. I called and was able to set up the pin.

I would suggest calling TransUnion to freeze your account. Its easier then the online portal.
