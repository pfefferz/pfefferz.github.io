To apply for an SBIR/STTR you'll need to register your entity with the System for Award Management (SAM). This post lists a few pieces of info to collect before registering. It also lists some tips, useful links and the list of representations and certifications that I needed to review.

**Info to Collect**

**1\. Tax ID**

Get a Tax ID (EIN) for your company. 180LawCo at [[link](http://www.180lawco.com/)\] helped me.

**2\. DUNS number**

Collect:

-   Business Name
    
-   Primary Doing Business As (DBA) Name
    
-   Physical Address (address, city, state, zip) - (Reminder: Personal Mailbox and virtual offices will not be accepted)
    
-   Branch & Subsidiary Locations
    

DUNS stands for Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS).

**3\. Find your NAICS Code(s)**

Find your classification in the North American Industry Classification System NAICS. See [[link](http://www.census.gov/eos/www/naics/2017NAICS/2017_NAICS_Manual.pdf)\].

Example:

I listed Centennial Software Solutions LLC under **541511** & **541512**:

5415 Computer Systems Design and Related ServicesT 

54151 Computer Systems Design and Related ServicesT 

**541511** Custom Computer Programming Services

This U.S. industry comprises establishments primarily engaged in writing, modifying, testing, and supporting software to meet the needs of a particular customer

**541512** Computer Systems Design Service

This U.S. industry comprises establishments primarily engaged in planning and designing computer systems that integrate computer hardware, software, and communication technologies. The hardware and software components of the system may be provided by this establishment or company as part of integrated services or may be provided by third parties or vendors. These establishments often install the system and train and support users of the system.

Illustrative Examples:

**4\. Find your Product and Service Code(s)**

**Tips**

**1\. FREE Help with SAM Registration**

The Federal Service Desk provides FREE help on U.S. Government contracts and grants. See [[https://www.fsd.gov](http://www.fsd.gov/)\].

Procurement Technical Assistance Centers (PTACs) provide free help with SAM registration. Find your local center at [[http://www.aptac-us.org/](http://www.aptac-us.org/)\].

**2\. Give your self a few days to register an entity through SAM.**

**3\. Keep a note pad for all the acronyms.**

**4\.** Save the "What happens next" info, set up your email filters to allow @sam.gov and @dla.mil addresses and watch out for "offers to help," there is FREE help available.

After registering you'll get this note:

What happens next?

1 If you provided a Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN), the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) will conduct a validation of your TIN and Taxpayer Name. This could take two business days. You will get an email from **@sam.gov** when that review is complete.

2 Your registration will then be sent to the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) Code system for assignment or validation of your CAGE Code. This also is a FREE service. This step averages two business days, but the DLA CAGE team can take up to ten business days, or longer, in peak periods. You will get an email from **@sam.gov** when that review is complete.

3 If the DLA CAGE team has any questions, they will contact the individual you listed as the Government Business Point of Contact (POC) via email. The email will come from an **@dla.mil** address. Please tell your Government Business POC to respond right away to any requests from an **@dla.mil** email. If a timely response is not received, your registration will be returned to SAM and your registration status changed to Work in Progress. You will have to resubmit and provide the requested information to DLA CAGE to continue.

4 You will get an email from **@sam.gov** when your registration passes these external validations and becomes Active. While you are waiting, use the Check Status tab in the SAM main navigation bar to see where your registration is in the review process.

**5 Remember, it is FREE to register and maintain your registration in SAM. If you get an email from any address that does not end in .gov or .mil, be cautious. If you get an email, text message, or phone call asking for money or payment of any amount, be very cautious. These parties do not represent the U.S. government. You engage third party vendors at your own risk.**

6 You can get FREE help with your registration by contacting our supporting Federal Service Desk (FSD). In addition, if you are located in the U.S. and its outlying areas, you can get FREE support from your local Procurement Technical Assistance Center (PTAC), an official resource for government contracting assistance. Check the PTAC website to locate your closest PTAC.
