# A Machine to Support Autonomic Computing

![gears_graphic](gears_graphic.png)

This post links to a 2005 paper that delved into the world of autonomic computing from IBM's Autonomic Computing initiative. This paper proposed groundwork for a self-reliant IT system that would ultimately lead to the developing of an innovative Autonomic CPU. This CPU, composed of interworking 'Cogs,' would help embed "autonomic self-managing properties" into computing technology.
