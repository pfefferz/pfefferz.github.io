# The computer I want is always $3000

The computer I want is always $3000. The computer I need is usually $2000.

I recently picked up a ThinkPad T460 model 20FNCTO1WW for $1,830.59 (spec below) after considering the [Dell XPS 15.](http://www.dell.com/en-us/shop/productdetails/xps-15-9560-laptop?ST=xps%2015&dgc=ST&cid=297819&lid=5695354&acd=123098073120560&ven1=sPyVmJDKS&ven2=e&ven3=263403736553147397) I went with the T460 because of:

###### Notes

-   One thing I tried to find on Lenovo's site was how much the 6 cell Li-Ion (72Wh) Cyl HC Rear Rear Battery makes the computer stick up. I found [this](http://forums.lenovo.com/t5/ThinkPad-T400-T500-and-newer-T/Difference-between-6-Cell-Li-iion-Cyl-HC-Rear-72Wh-and-6-Cell-Li/td-p/1632536) which linked to [this](http://forum.notebookreview.com/attachments/batt2-jpg.108160/), but I couldn't find an image that showed the actual laptop. For the benefit of others, here's how much the battery causes the computer to stick up.
    
-   Regarding Dell hardware, my [Dell Precision 7510](http://www.dell.com/us/business/p/precision-m7510-workstation/pd) has held up. Its a bit on the heavy side though.

**Sep 30th 2018 Update**

Wrote [ThinkPad T460 Memory Upgrade](http://www.zachpfeffer.com/single-post/2018/09/29/ThinkPad-T460-Memory-Upgrade) after I decided to upgrade the memory to 32 GB after starting to do more programmable logic design work with Vivado (which requires a \_lot\_ of memory, see [[link](http://www.zachpfeffer.com/single-post/Xilinx-20182-Software-Tool-Installation-Overview-and-Assessment)\] which reports memory needs topping out at 50 GB!).

**Apr 6th 2018 Update**

The laptop seems to be holding up after a more than a year. Over that year I was using the Dell Precision 7510 for a lot of workloads and only using the T460 for lighter duties. Over the last 4 months I've just had the T460 and I've been using it for the workloads I was using the 7510 for. With the higher usage I've noticed that Virtual Box is a bit slower and that I need to close Chrome more often because it seems to take up a lot of memory when I use it.

The battery life is \_way\_ better than the 7510.

The keyboard also continues to be very nice.

Going forward I'm considering moving into the cloud since many of the Xilinx workloads require many 10's of GB's of memory and many 100's of GB's of storage.
