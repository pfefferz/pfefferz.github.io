Recruitment is a crucial part of any business strategy because skilled professionals are what make your venture a success.

Few can take an idea and turn it into a reality without help and when it comes to bringing the right people in, the pitfalls are as dangerous as the rewards are lucrative. In the software industry, it’s perhaps as tough as any other marketplace because of the collection of talent out there.

Tech recruitment can be a daunting prospect because there are so many talented people hunting roles. It’s a key growth area and one in which a single job advert can yield a huge number of CVs to sift through, [but as CNBC confirms there is a shortage of tech workers out there too](http://www.cnbc.com/2017/08/23/why-we-have-a-shortage-of-tech-workers-in-the-u-s.html). To get the right person identified and then tempted to join your company is going to take a lot of work.

Where do you start? What are you looking for? How can you make sure you get the right person for the right role?

Here are four do’s and don’ts for recruiting in the software industry.

**Do: Be clear about what you want**

Before you decide to throw the advert out there, be very clear about what you want. If you set key parameters, skill sets that are essential and a clear pay grade, you’ll cut down on the number of applicants that are unsuitable for the role.

The applications might flow in, but by being clear and concise you might stop speculative approaches from people in the industry fishing for change. They’ll waste your time and that’s a drain on your resources.

**Don’t: Simply look for college degrees**

It would be easy to glance down to the qualifications section of an application and go for those who seem to have the skills you require, but this could well be a mistake. [IBM CEO Ginni Rometty told USA Today that not all tech jobs require a college degree ](http://eu.usatoday.com/story/tech/columnist/2016/12/13/we-need-fill-new-collar-jobs-employers-demand-ibms-rometty/95382248/)saying; “Jobs are being created that demand new skills – which in turn requires new approaches to education, training and recruiting.”

Maybe your applicant has shown a willingness to take vocational classes specific to your needs or has the experience in a role without qualification elsewhere. Be open-minded when perusing the candidates.

**Do: Conduct a rigorous interview**

The software industry is going to require much more than a few questions probing a person’s background or motivations. Make sure your interview tests the claims an applicant makes, perhaps even to a technical level with questions aimed at uncovering an embellishment in their CV.

Following these guidelines will help you drill down to specifics when examining a candidate.

**Don’t: Overcomplicate**

The digital age has allowed us unparalleled access to information, algorithms and the like. Hiring has become a process like any other, with the [Harvard Business Review explaining how the recruitment process has evolved](http://hbr.org/2019/05/recruiting) to become impersonal and electronic.

Once you’ve asked the right questions and ensured your candidate has the necessary skills, use your judgement, not software, to decide if they’re the right fit for you. Getting the interview right can confirm if they can do the job, but only you as a person can judge if they’re the right personality fit for your organization.
