# Time from Home to Ticket and Ticket to Gate at Denver International Airport on 2017-10-22

**Home to Ticket**

It took 50 minutes to get from Centennial to the Southwest automated kiosk. Parked on the first level of the garage.

**Ticket to Home**

It took 40 min from getting my ticket at the Southwest automated kiosk to gate C24.Â 

Took the southern security gate. It was full. The line extended a little past the actual entry point.

Got in an X-RAY line that was implementing a new process President Trump requested: all food must be presented together, shones on rollers and all electronics bigger than a cell phone needed to be displayed. No issues.
