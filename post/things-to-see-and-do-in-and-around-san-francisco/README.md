# Things to See and Do In and Around San Francisco

![golden_gate_bridge](golden_gate_bridge.jpg)

This post lists some things to see and do around San Francisco that my amazing wife and great kids helped me make for one of my cool sisters. Distances are given from the The Ritz-Carlton, Half Moon Bay. I list directions and some details so that you can find everything in one place. Leave a message if I left off a detail you think is important or if you have a suggestion on another great place to visit.

Why the Ritz? My sisters and her family is staying there. She asked for the list for their upcoming trip and I thought I'd share my recommendations with everyone.
